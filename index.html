    <p>The Isle of Berk is a small island that boasts cliffs, beaches, waterfalls, streams and several large forests Its has a very controversial climate (being from Manchester that claim says a lot)</p>


    <p>Here are a few claims that Hiccup has made:</p>

     
    <p class="font">"It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three"</p>


    <p class="font">"We've got ice, we've got snow and we've got more ice"</p>


    <p class="font">"This is Berk, boasting the kind of balmy fun-in-the-sun climate that will give you frostbite on your spleen." </p>
