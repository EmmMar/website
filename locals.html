<h4>The Local Transport</h4>

<p>One of the ways to view this glorious landscape is from high above. The most convenient way to do this is by taking 
    a trip on the local dragons. Yes, you read that write DRAGONS. These fearless vikings have been training and looking after 
    these glorious creatures since Hiccup discovered they were friendly. If you don't believe us book a trip on one of these 
    animals as soon as you arrive at this exclusive location* 
</p>

<p>Have you read enough? Do you want to take this holiday of a lifetime? Well, why don't you rush down to the nearest Dragon Tours Outlet** and book this once in a lifetime trip that caters to your every need. Expense is no option, you will want for nothing and it will feel like one heck of a dream.</p>

<p>Yes people, that's correct the best to enjoy this island is to behave like one of the vikings and grab yourself a dragon and hop on, for the ride of a lifetime.</p>
